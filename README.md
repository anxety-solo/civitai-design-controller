# 🎨 CivitAI Shits (Design) Controller | WIP

> **The extension works halfway...**</br>

> This is my first extension and my first major project with JS, so the implementation is pretty terrible :3

> As a result, it may not remove all decorations or user interface elements 100% in every case.</br>
> It may also cause false hiding...
